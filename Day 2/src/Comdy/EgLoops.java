		/*
		 * 1. Arithmetic Operators
              + : Adds two operands.

              - : Subtracts the right operand from the left.

              * : Multiplies two operands.

              / : Divides the left operand by the right.

              % : Returns the remainder of the division (modulus)
		 
		 *2. Relational (Comparison) Operators
              == : Checks if two values are equal.

              != : Checks if two values are not equal.

              > : Checks if the left operand is greater than the right.

              < : Checks if the left operand is less than the right.

              >= : Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right.

              <= : Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right.
              
          *3. Logical Operators
                   && : Returns true if both conditions are true (Logical AND).

                   || : Returns true if at least one condition is true (Logical OR).

                   ! : Reverses the logical state (Logical NOT).
		
		
		 *4. Assignment Operators
             = : Assigns the value on the right to the variable on the left.

             += : Adds right operand to left operand and assigns the result to the left.

             -= : Subtracts right operand from left and assigns the result.

             *= : Multiplies and assigns the result to the left.

            /= : Divides and assigns the result to the left.

            %= : Modulus and assigns the result to the left.
             

		 *5. Unary Operators
               + : Unary plus (positive value).

               - : Unary minus (negation).

               ++ : Increments a value by 1.

               -- : Decrements a value by 1.

               ! : Logical NOT (negates a boolean value).
               
               
		 *6. Bitwise Operators
              & : Bitwise AND of two operands.

              | : Bitwise OR of two operands.

              ^ : Bitwise XOR of two operands.

              ~ : Bitwise NOT (inverts all bits).

              << : Left shift operator.

              >> : Right shift operator.

              >>>: Zero-fill right shift.

           *a)Increment operator: ++
           *pre-increment:  ++i
           *post-increment: i++
           *
           *b) Decrement operator :--
           *pre-decrement:  --i
